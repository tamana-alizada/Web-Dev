    <!-- Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
    Saturation (shows the intensity of the color) is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
    Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white. -->
